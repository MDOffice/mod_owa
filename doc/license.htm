<h2>ORACLE COMMUNITY SOURCE LICENSE<br>
(FOR <font color="#000080">MOD_OWA</font>)</h2>
 
<p>
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ORACLE
COMMUNITY SOURCE LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;).  ANY USE, REPRODUCTION
OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
</p>

<h4>1. RIGHTS GRANTED.</h4>
<p>
Oracle Corporation (&quot;Oracle&quot;) hereby grants You (as either
an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under this license)
a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive copyright license to use,
copy, modify, distribute and sublicense the software program accompanying
this license (the &quot;Program&quot;), including any end user documentation
accompanying the software program (the &quot;Documentation&quot;), in
source and binary forms.  Oracle also grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive patent license under Oracle's Licensed Patents solely to
make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Program
in source code and object code form and to sublicense, directly and
indirectly, such rights.  This license shall not apply to any modifications
of the Program or to any combination of the Program with any other
technology.  &quot;Licensed Patents&quot; shall mean patent claims that
are licensable by Oracle and that are necessarily infringed by the use or
sale of the Program.  You agree not to remove any product identification,
copyright notices, or other notices or proprietary restrictions contained
in the Programs.
</p>
<p>
Other than as expressly provided in this paragraph, You receive no right or
license to the intellectual property of Oracle under this Agreement, whether
expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.  All rights in the Program
not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
</p>

<h4>2. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS.</h4>
<p>
If You choose to distribute the Program, You must also comply with the
following requirements:
</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>If You distribute the Program in source code form, you must license the
Program under the same terms as set forth in this Agreement;</li>
<li>If You distribute the Program in object code form, You must make the
source code for the Program available on a medium customarily used for
software exchange;</li>
<li>If You distribute the Program in object code form, You may do so under
Your own license agreement provided that Your license:
<ol type="i">
<li>does not conflict with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;</li>
<li>effectively disclaims on behalf of Oracle all warranties and conditions,
express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantibilty
or fitness for a particular purpose;</li>
<li>effectively excludes Oracle's liability for ALL damages, including direct,
indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost
profits;</li>
<li>states that any provisions that differ from this Agreement are offered
by You alone; and</li>
<li>states that source code for the Program is available from You and

</ol>
</li>
<li>Any distribution of the Program must contain the following copyright
notice in a conspicuous location:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#000080">&quot;Copyright 1999, 2000
Oracle Corporation.  All rights reserved.&quot;</font><br>
In addition, if You modify the Program, you must identify yourself as the
author of the modification in such a way that allows subsequent recipients
to identify the originator of the modification.</li>
</ol>
 
<h4>3. ADDITIONAL TERMS OFFERED BY YOU.</h4>
<p>
In distributing the Program, You may choose to accept certain responsibilities
regarding the Program with respect to end users, business partners and the
like.  If You choose to offer terms in addition to those provided in this
Agreement, for example warranty, support or indemnity terms, You may do
so solely on Your own behalf and You agree to indemnify, defend and hold
Oracle harmless for any liability, damages or losses arising from claims
brought by a third party against Oracle related to any such additional
terms.  In addition, You agree to indemnify Oracle for any liability,
damages or losses arising from a claim brought by a third party that Your
distribution of the Program in a modified format or as combined with other
technology infringes a copyright, patent, trade secret or other intellectual
property right.  For purposes of clarity, You shall not have an obligation
to indemnify Oracle for a claim of infringement to the extent such a claim
is based on the Program, in its unmodified or standalone form, infringing
a third party's intellectual property rights.  You agree that You will not
enter into any settlement that binds Oracle without Oracle's prior written
consent.
</p>

<h4>4. PUBLICITY.</h4>
<p>
You may not use &quot;Oracle&quot;, any term beginning with the letters
&quot;Ora&quot;, any other term likely to cause confusion with
&quot;Oracle&quot; or any trademarks adopted by Oracle to identify the
Program as any portion of your tradename or trademark or to otherwise
endorse or promote products derived from the Program.
</p>
 
<h4>5. NO WARRANTY.</h4>
<p>
This Program is provided &quot;as is&quot;, without warranty of any kind.  ALL
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OR MERCHANTIBILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.
</p>

<h4>6. LIABILITY.</h4>
<p>
IN NO EVENT SHALL ORACLE CORPORATION BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT
NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE,
DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY
OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS PROGRAM,
EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
</p>

<h4>7. GENERAL.</h4>
<p>
Your rights under this Agreement shall immediately terminate if You fail
to comply with any of the material terms of this Agreement.  In addition,
if You institute patent litigation against Oracle with respect to a patent
applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by Oracle to You under this
Agreement shall automatically terminate as of the date such litigation is
filed.  In addition, if You institute patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
Program infringes Your patent(s) or contributes to or induces infringement
of Your patent(s), then any patent rights granted to You under this Agreement
shall automatically terminate as of the date the litigation is filed.  Upon
termination of this Agreement, You agree to immediately cease use and
distribution of the Program.  However, Your obligations under Paragraph 3
(&quot;Additional Terms Offered By You&quot;) of this Agreement shall survive
termination.
</p>
<p>
The Program is a &quot;commercial item&quot; as defined in FAR
2.101.  Government software rights in the Program include only those rights
customarily provided to the public as defined in this License.  This customary
commercial license in computer software is provided in accordance with
FAR 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for the Department of Defense purchases,
DFAR 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software
Documentation).  Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Program
with only those rights set forth herein.
</p>
<p>
You agree to comply fully with all laws and regulations of the United States
and other countries (&quot;Export Laws&quot;)to assure that neither the
Program, nor any direct products thereof are (1) exported, directly or
indirectly, in violation of Export Laws, or (2) are used for any purpose
prohibited by Export Laws, including, without limitation, nuclear, chemical,
or biological weapons proliferation.
</p>
<p>
If any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
This Agreement will be governed by and construed under the laws of the
State of California, without giving effect to such state's conflict of law
principles. Any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall
be instituted in a state or federal court in San Francisco or San Mateo
County, California.  You agree to submit to the jurisdiction of, and agree
that venue is proper in, these courts in any such legal action or proceeding.
</p>
<p>
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties concerning its
subject matter and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous, written or
oral negotiations, correspondence, understandings and agreements between the
parties respecting the subject matter of this Agreement.  Only Oracle may
modify this Agreement.  Oracle may choose to publish new versions of this
Agreement from time to time.  Each new version of this Agreement will be
given a distinguishing version number.  The Program may always be distributed
subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received.  In
addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, You may elect
to distribute the Program under the new version. The failure of Oracle to
enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement shall not be construed to be
a waiver of the right of Oracle to later enforce such provisions.
